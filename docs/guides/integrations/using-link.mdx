# Integrating using the Link Element

### Introduction
This guide will walk you through integrating the [Link Element](/docs/api/elements/link/intro) into your application to simplify the `liability` account creation process.

:::info
This integration assumes that you are not using Plaid as a data aggregator for your user's financial accounts. If you are using Plaid, see [**Integrating using Plaid**](/docs/guides/integrations/using-plaid) instead.
:::

### Prerequisites
Before you get started, make sure you have the following:

- An `API_KEY` from https://dashboard.methodfi.com. Depending on which [Method Environment](/docs/api/environments) you would like to follow this guide with, make sure your requests are made to the correct URL.

### 1. Retrieve an entity
First, retrieve an entity through the Method API. If you don't have any entities, [create an entity](/docs/api/core/entities/create-individual). This entity represents a user of your application.


<EntitiesList />

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "ent_au22b1fbFJbp8",
      ...
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

➡️ See [the entity object](/docs/api/core/entities/object) for more info.

### 2. Retrieve a source account
Next, retrieve an `ach` account associated with the previously selected entity. If there are no `ach` accounts associated with this entity, [create an ach account](/docs/api/core/accounts/create) for them.

<AccountsList />

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "acc_JMJZT6r7iHi8e",
      "holder_id": "ent_au22b1fbFJbp8",
      "type": "ach",
      ...
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

➡️ See [the account object](/docs/api/core/accounts/object) for more info.

### 3. Create a liability destination account
In this step, you will launch the [Link Element](/docs/api/elements/link/intro) within your application to create a `liability` account for your user.

**1.** First create a link `element_token` associated with your entity.

<ElementsCreateLinkToken2 />

```json
{
  "element_token": "pk_elem_BtzySdrQGFmLdAPw5gXSQNCxQkhCkT3K"
}
```

➡️ See [create a Link Element token](/docs/api/elements/link/implementation/create-token) for more info.

**2.** With the retrieved `element_token`, [launch the Link Element](/docs/api/elements/link/implementation/launch-link) in your app through a WebView.
```
https://elements.production.methodfi.com?token={element_token}
```

**3.** Then finally [exchange](/docs/api/elements/link/implementation/exchange-public-accounts) the `public_account_token` for an account after your user successfully completes the Link Element flow.

<ElementsExchangePublicAccountToken />

```json
{
  "id": "acc_AXthnzpBnxxWP",
  ...
}
```


### 4. Create a payment

Now that you have the source account `id` and the destination account `id`, you can now make a payment.

<PaymentsCreate />

```json
{
  "id": "pmt_rPrDPEwyCVUcm",
  "source": "acc_JMJZT6r7iHi8e",
  "destination": "acc_AXthnzpBnxxWP",
  "amount": 5000,
  "description": "Loan Pmt",
  "status": "pending",
  "error": null,
  "created_at": "2020-12-09T00:42:31.209Z",
  "updated_at": "2020-12-09T00:43:30.996Z"
}
```

➡️  See the [create a payment endpoint](/docs/api/core/payments/create) for more info.


### Conclusion
In this guide, you have completed the following:
- Created a `liability` destination account for an existing entity without using an external data aggregator.
- And finally, you created a payment from an existing `ach` source account to a destination `liability` account.
