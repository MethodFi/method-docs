# Payments
A payment represents the transfer of money from one account ([the source](/guides/source-accounts))
to another account ([the destination](/guides/destination-accounts)). Payments are created
to either transfer money between bank accounts, or to payoff debt.

In this section you'll learn about the requirements for creating a payment, as well as
the different lifecycle statuses a payment will transition into before it is completed.
