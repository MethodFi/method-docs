# Payments
A payment represents the transfer of money from one account (the source)
to another account (the destination). Payments are created
to either transfer money between bank accounts, or to payoff debt.

In this section you'll learn about the requirements for creating a payment, as well as
the different lifecycle statuses a payment will transition into before it is completed.
