# Environment setup

Before we start interacting with the Method API, let's first make sure
you have __API keys__ for the `development` environment which you can get by
signing up in the [Method Dashboard](https://dashboard.methodfi.com).

#### Sample API key
```shell
sk_WyZEWVfTcH7GqmPzUPk65Vjc
```

### API environments

Although this guide will be done in the `development` environment, each
step can also be done in the `sandbox`, and `production` environments. Learn more about
how each [environment](/api/environments) works.

:::note
Following this guide in the `developement` environment will __not__ move real
money from one account to another, nor will any data be real.
:::

### Verifying access

Let's verify that your API keys work. We'll do this by performing a health check of
the `development` environment. You can utilize any of Method's official
[API client libraries](/libraries#api-client-libraries) to do this.

#### Request
<QuickStartHealthCheck />

#### Response
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "data": null,
    "message": "pong"
}
```
