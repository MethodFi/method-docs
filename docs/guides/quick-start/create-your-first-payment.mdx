# Create your first payment

‚ú® __Method Payments__ allows you to push funds to any type of debt account (mortgage, student loan, credit cards, bills and more)
at more than 10,000 financial institutions or loan servicers.

## Steps
  - [Create an entity](#1-creating-an-entity) that will become the holder/owner of both the source and destination accounts.
  - [Create a source account](#2-create-a-source-account) from which the payment's funds will be retrieved.
  - [Create a destination account](#3-create-a-destination-account) where the payment's funds will be sent to.
  - [Create a payment](#4-create-your-first-payment) with the source and destination accounts created.

## 1. Creating an entity
For this step, we'll create an `individual` entity that will become the holder of the accounts. The holder entity is the
legal owner of any account connected. Using an incorrect entity with an account will lead to payment failure.

‚ÑπÔ∏è See [entities](/guides/entities) to learn more.

## 2. Create a source account

Now that we have an entity to hold accounts, we can create a source account for the entity we just created.
This account will become our payment source later on. Source accounts can only be of type `ach` which includes
checking/savings accounts.

‚ÑπÔ∏è See [source accounts](/guides/accounts/overview#source-accounts) to learn more

### ACH Verification

:::info
All ACH source accounts need to be verified. See [ACH Verification](/guides/accounts/ach-verification) to learn more

## 3. Create a destination account

Similar to the previous step, we need to create a destination account where the payment funds
will be sent to. Destination accounts are `liability` accounts
which includes any type of liability (personal loans, credit cards, student loans, etc.)


### Using Method Data
üí° You can automatically retrieve all of an entity's liabilities using
__Method Data__. See the [retrieve an entity's debts](/guides/quick-start/retrieve-an-entitys-debts) guide
to learn more.

## 4. Create your first payment

You now have all the information you need to create your first payment. Using the source account's id (`acc_b9q2XVAnNFbp3`)
and the destination accounts id (`acc_Zc4F2aTLt8CBt`), we'll create a $50 payment with the description `Loan Pmt`.

üöÄ It's that easy! The payment will be posted at the destination account in 2 business days.
