# Create your first payment

A payment is a transfer of funds from a [source account](/guides/source-accounts)
to a [destination account](/guides/destination-accounts).

### Steps
  - [Create an entity](#1-creating-an-entity) that will become the holder/owner of both the
source and destination accounts.
  - [Create a source account](#2-create-a-source-account) from which the payment's funds will be retrieved.
  - [Create a destination account](#3-create-a-destination-account) where the payment's funds will be sent to.
  - [Create a payment](#4-create-your-first-payment) with the source and destination accounts created.

### 1. Creating an entity
For this step, we'll create an `individual` entity that will become the holder/owner
of both source and destination accounts.

ℹ️ See [entities](/guides/entities) to learn more.

  "updated_at": "2020-12-09T00:40:51.107Z"
}
```

### 2. Create a source account

Now that we have an entity to hold accounts, we can create a source account for the entity we just created.
This account will become our payment source later on. Source accounts can only be of type `ach` which includes
checking/savings accounts.

ℹ️ See [source accounts](/guides/source-accounts) to learn more

#### Request
<QuickStartCreateSource />

#### Response
```json
{
  "id": "acc_b9q2XVAnNFbp3",
  "holder_id": "ent_au22b1fbFJbp8",
  "type": "ach",
  "ach": {
    "routing": "367537407",
    "number": "57838927",
    "type": "checking"
  },
  "liability": null,
  "metadata": null,
  "status": "active",
  "capabilities": [
    "payments:receive",
    "payments:send"
  ],
  "created_at": "2020-12-09T00:40:51.107Z",
  "updated_at": "2020-12-09T00:40:51.107Z"
}
```

### 3. Create a destination account

Similar to the previous step, we need to create a destination account where the payment funds
will be sent to. Destination accounts can either be of type `ach` which includes checking/savings
accounts, or `liability` which includes any type of liability (personal loans, credit cards, student loans, etc.)

ℹ️ See [destination accounts](/guides/destination-accounts) to learn more

#### Request
<QuickStartCreateDestination />

#### Response
```json
{
  "id": "acc_Zc4F2aTLt8CBt",
  "holder_id": "ent_au22b1fbFJbp8",
  "type": "liability",
  "ach": null,
  "liability": {
    "mch_id": "mch_2",
    "mask": "4455"
  },
  "metadata": null,
  "status": "active",
  "capabilities": [
    "payments:receive"
  ],
  "created_at": "2020-12-09T02:56:19.548Z",
  "updated_at": "2020-12-09T02:56:19.548Z"
}
```

### 4. Create your first payment

You now have all the information you need to create your first payment. Using the source account's id (`acc_b9q2XVAnNFbp3`)
and the destination accounts id (`acc_Zc4F2aTLt8CBt`), we'll create a $50 payment with the description `Loan Pmt`.

ℹ️ See [payments](/guides/payments) to learn more

#### Request
<QuickStartCreatePayment />

#### Response
```json
{
  "id": "pmt_rPrDPEwyCVUcm",
  "source": "acc_b9q2XVAnNFbp3",
  "destination": "acc_Zc4F2aTLt8CBt",
  "amount": 5000,
  "description": "Loan Pmt",
  "status": "pending",
  "error": null,
  "metadata": null,
  "created_at": "2020-12-09T00:42:31.209Z",
  "updated_at": "2020-12-09T00:43:30.996Z"
}
```
