# Create an entity

There are two types of entities, individuals and corporations. In the Method ecosystem,
an [individual entity](/guides/entities/create-an-entity#individual-entity) represents
a single person, while a [corporation entity](/guides/entities/create-an-entity#corporation-entity)
represents a company. Specific information is required to identify each type of entity, as well
as enable [capabilities](/guides/entities/capabilities), which define what actions they
can take.

:::tip
Creating an entity should be your first priority when integrating with Method. Entities
function as legal owners / holders for Method accounts.
:::

ℹ️ See [the entity object](/api/core/entities/object) for details on the API.
