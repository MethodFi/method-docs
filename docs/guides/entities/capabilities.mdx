# Capabilities

Capabilities determine the possible actions an entity is allowed to take. Entities are
granted capabilities based on the information provided.

Method performs a KYC (Know Your Customer) process to verify the entity's identity with
the information provided. This is crucial in detecting fraud and remaining compliant
with banking regulations.

An entity's capabilities can be revoked due to payment failures. See
[payment errors and capabilities](/guides/payments/lifecycle-and-errors#errors-and-capabilities).
