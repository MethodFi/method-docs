# Identity verification

In lieu of using Method's Auth Element, you can use the Auth Session endpoint to automatically retrieve
and link all of an individual entity's debts to Method. This additional verification
will require the entity to answer a set of security questions that will verify
their identity and ownership over those debts.

:::caution
Only entities with the `data:retrieve` in `available_capabilities` can continue
with this guide. Refer back to the [retrieve data capability](/guides/entities/capabilities#retrieve-data)
section if you wish to follow this guide.
:::

:::info
If your organization is enrolled in Method's non-KBA authentication, no questions will be returned in the
Create Auth Session response.

### Create an auth session
The first step in verifying an entity's identity is creating an auth session.
This request returns a list of security questions that the entity must
correctly answer.

<EntitiesCreateIndividualAuthSession />

---

### Update an auth session
Next we'll provide the answers to the security questions. This request
may either return a list of additional security questions, or a
`authenticated` boolean which indicates that the verification was successful.

<EntitiesUpdateIndividualAuthSession />

#### Response (Verification Successful)
Once we receive a true `authenticated` key, we have successfully verified this entity's
identity and retrieved their debt accounts.

```json
{
  "questions": [],
  "authenticated": true,
}
```

#### Response (Additional Verification Required)
In some cases, you may need to go through an additional set of security questions to fully verify.
Simply repeat the request with answers for the new set of security questions.

```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "id" : "qtn_7smgfLrU6M5tt",
      "text" : "Which of the following is a current or previous employer?",
      "answers" : [
        {
          "id" : "ans_ZExAcSeGjgEwS",
          "text" : "Men's Wearhouse"
        },
        {
          "id" : "ans_8MRLxgtQxEmYV",
          "text" : "Target"
        },
        ...
      ]
    },
    ...
  ],
  "authenticated": false
}
```

---

### Retrieve the created liability accounts
Now we'll retrieve the accounts created from the entity's completed Auth Element.
We'll use the entities' ID to retrieve all of the debts under their name.

The retrieved accounts created from this flow have the following capabilities:

* `data:retrieve` capability indicating that it was connected as part of this flow (Method Data).
* `payments:receive` capability indicating that the account is fully setup to be used for payments via Method Payments.
* `data:sync` capability indicating this liability can receive enhanced data and nightly data updates via Method Sync. ➡️ Learn more here.
