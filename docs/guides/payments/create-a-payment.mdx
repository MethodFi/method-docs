# Create a payment

Payments are created to transfer funds from one account to another. This could
either be between two ACH accounts, or from an ACH account to a Liability account.
Below are requirements to successfully create a payment:
- A [source account](/guides/source-accounts) with
the `payments:send` [capability](/guides/source-accounts/verification-and-capabilities) owned
by an [entity](/guides/entities) with the same `payments:send` [capability](/guides/entities/kyc-and-capabilities).
- A [destination account](/guides/destination-accounts) with
the `payments:receive` [capability](/guides/source-accounts/verification-and-capabilities) owned
by an [entity](/guides/entities) with the same `payments:receive` [capability](/guides/entities/kyc-and-capabilities).
- A description that is 10 characters or less.
- An amount that is at least $1.00

:::caution
If the following requirements above are met, a payment can be created with __any__ source
account within your organization to __any__ destination account within your organization
regardless of the holder/entity.

__Ex.__ Peter owns a Chase Checking. Sandy owns a FedLoan account. A payment can be sent from
Peter's Chase to Sandy's FedLoan.
:::

:::note
Once a payment is created, it usually takes __3 business days__ for the payment to be completed. Based on
limits set for your organization, some payments may take more time.

ℹ️ See [the payment object](/api/core/payments/object) for details on the API.

### Payment limits
Payment limits are set for each organization on each [environment](/api/environments#environment-breakdown).
This is to prevent fraud, and to reduce the risk of having returned payments.

transition into after it is created.
