# Monetize with payment fees
Make money from each payment by charging a fee. Method
support two types of payment fees:

- [Total fee](#total-fee) - charging a flat fee on the payment.
- [Markup fee](#markup-fee) - charging a fee on top of Method's per-payment fee.

:::info
Accrued fee credits will be applied to your current month's invoice.
If the sum of your fees is greater than your current month's invoice,
you can choose to either keep them as credit for the next month's invoice,
or choose to have Method transfer the credits directly to your bank
account.
:::

➡️ See the [fee API reference](/api/core/payments/object#payment-fee-types) for more details.

### Total Fee
Charge a flat fee from the amount received by payment's
destination account. If a total fee is applied to a
payment, this payment will still be included as a billable
item in your monthly invoice.


<PaymentsCreateWithTotalFee />

The following equation explains how the `total` fee is applied
to the payment based on the example request.

```
Received by destination = Payment - Total fee
$48.00                  = $50.00  - $2.00
```
- __Accrued fee credit:__ $2.00
- __Included in monthly invoice:__ Yes

### Markup Fee
Charge a fee on top of Method's per-payment fee from the
amount received by payment's destination account. Since this
type of fee already accounts for Method's per-payment fee,
this payment <u>will not</u> be included in your monthly invoice.

<PaymentsCreateWithMarkupFee />

The following equation explains how the `markup` fee is applied
to the payment based on the example request.

```
Received by destination = Payment - Markup fee - Example Method per-payment fee
$47.00                  = $50.00  - $2.00      - $1.00
```
- __Accrued fee credit:__ $2.00
- __Included in monthly invoice:__ No
