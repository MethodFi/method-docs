# Lifecycle and errors
Here we'll learn about the different statuses a payment can transition
into after it has been created, as well as learn of possible errors
that may result in a payment's failure and how Method handles them.

---
### Lifecycle
Once a payment has been created, it will initially have the `pending` status. This indicates that the payment
has not yet been processed, and is still allowed to be `canceled`.

:::caution
Only payments in the `pending` status can be `canceled`.
:::

If the payment is created __before__ the current business day's [cutoff time](/api/core/payments/object#cutoff-time)
(Monday - Friday 2:30 PM CST), it will be processed and transition into the `processing` status. If it is
created __after__ the current business day's cutoff time, the payment will be processed on the next business day.

If the payment was successful, the transferred funds should be reflected on the destination account
in the next morning. However, for the purpose of security, most financial institutions have varying holding
periods which may cause the funds to reflect at a later date.

Once a payment has been sent to the destination account, its status will transition from `processing` to `sent`.

ℹ️ See [the payment statuses](/api/core/payments/object#payment-statuses) for details on payment statuses.

### Errors
Unsuccessful payments result in either the `failed` or `reversed` status.

#### Failed payments
When a payment's status transitions from `processing` to `failed`, this indicates that the
retrieval of funds from the source account failed __before__ the funds reached the destination account.
This can occur as a result of the following:
- The source account does not have sufficient funds for the amount of the payment.
- The holder of the source account revoked authorization with their bank to prevent Method from pulling
the funds.
- The source account had invalid account information.
- The source account has been closed.

#### Reversed payments
When a payment's status transitions from `sent` to `reversal_required`, this indicates that
the retrieval of funds from the source account failed __after__ the funds reached the
destination account. To resolve this, Method will create [reversal](/api/core/payments/reversals/object) to retrieve
the incorrectly transferred funds from the destination account.

:::note
The transition from `sent` to `reversed` can occur within 60 days
of the failure's occurrence.

### Errors and Capabilities

To protect our customers from risky transactions, Method automatically revokes
capabilities from either the accounts or account holders (entities) that are associated
with a failed payment.

Method revokes capabilities for an account or account holder based on the following
categories of payment failures (__Authorization__, __Administrative__, __Insufficient funds__).

#### Authorization

The account holder reported to their account's financial institution that a transaction
processed through Method was unauthorized. As a result, both the account and the account
holder (entity) will then be `disabled` and revoked of all capabilities.

#### Administrative

Payment failures due to administrative errors are caused by any of the following:
- Incorrect account information: the account number or routing number is incorrect.
- The account could not be located.
- The account has been closed.

The account will then be `disabled` and revoked of all capabilities.

#### Insufficient funds

If repeated payment failures occur due to a lack of funds from a source account,
the account will be `disabled` and revoked of all capabilities.


:::note
If you believe that an account or account holder was incorrectly `disabled`
and would like to re-enable capabilities, contact team@methodfi.com to resolve
this issue.

### Setting up webhooks for lifecycle transitions
To automatically get notified once a payment transitions into a specific status,
you can set up a webhook that sends information regarding each transition.

ℹ️ See [the webhook object](/api/core/webhooks/object) for details on the API.
