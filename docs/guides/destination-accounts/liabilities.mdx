# Liabilities
Each liability account belongs to a financial institution, which is also referred to as
a merchant. These types of accounts are only able to receive payment funds, and
require minimal verification.

ℹ️ See [liability account](/api/core/accounts/object#example---liability-account-student-loans-credit-cards-etc)
for details on the API.

### Merchants
Merchants are financial institutions that accept payments for liability accounts. A merchant's
`mch_id` is required to create a liability account. Below are a couple of examples on how to search
for a merchant.

#### Search merchant by name
<MerchantSearchByName />

#### Search merchant by Plaid institution Id
<MerchantSearchPlaidIns />

##### Response
```json
[
  {
    "mch_id": "mch_2",
    "parent_name": "FedLoan",
    "name": "FedLoan Servicing - Student Loans",
    "logo": "https://static.methodfi.com/mch-logos/1616215578688-fedloan.png",
    "description": null,

      ],
      "finicity": [

    }
  }
]
```

ℹ️ See [list merchants](/api/core/merchants/list) for details on the API.

### Creating a liability account through the API
Before making a request, ensure that you have gathered the following liability account information:
- The `mch_id` of the merchant that corresponds to the account's financial institution.
- The `account_number` for the liability account.
- The `id` of the entity that owns the account.

<AccountsCreateLiability />

##### Response
```json
{
  "id": "acc_Zc4F2aTLt8CBt",
  "holder_id": "ent_au22b1fbFJbp8",
  "type": "liability",
  "ach": null,
  "liability": {
    "mch_id": "mch_2",
    "mask": "4455"
  },
  "clearing": null,
  "metadata": null,
  "status": "active",
  "capabilities": [
    "payments:receive"
  ],
  "error": null,
  "created_at": "2020-12-09T02:56:19.548Z",
  "updated_at": "2020-12-09T02:56:19.548Z"
}
```

##### Verification and Errors
Verification for liability accounts happens in real-time upon creation. If verification fails and returns
an error of type `INVALID_ACCOUNT_NUMBER` this indicates either of the following:
- No account was found corresponding to the provided account number.
- The account is closed or no longer exists.

ℹ️ See [create liability account](/api/core/accounts/create#example---liability-account) for details on the API.

element that handles:
1. Searching a merchant
2. Collecting account number information
3. Creation of the liability account.
