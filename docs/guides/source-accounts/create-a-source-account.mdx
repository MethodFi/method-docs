# Create a source account

A source account is an account from which payment funds will be pulled.
In the Method ecosystem, this type of account is referred to as an ACH account.

ℹ️ See [the account object](/api/core/accounts/object#example---ach-account-checking--savings) for details on the API.

### ACH accounts

:::note
Only ACH accounts are allowed to be used as a payment source. Therefore, Liability
accounts cannot become source accounts.
:::

You only need basic ACH information to start creating a source account:

- A __routing number__ which is used to identify a bank account or financial institution.
- An __account number__ that uniquely identifies the account.
- The __type__ of source account (checking or savings).


This information can be collected from your users through the following methods:

- __Plaid Auth__ - Plaid provides this information within their [Plaid Auth product](https://plaid.com/docs/auth/).
- __MX__ - MX provides this information within their [Verification product](https://docs.mx.com/atrium#premium_features_verification)
- __User provided__ - you can alternatively collect this information from your users using
your own implementation.

:::note
The `holder_id` field in the request below refers to the `id` of an entity that owns this account.
If you have not created an entity, see [create an entity](/guides/entities/create-an-entity).

### Next steps
Before we can start pulling funds from a source account, verification must first be
done to verify ownership of the created account. In the next topic we'll go through the
various verification methods available, so you can select the best one for your
use case.
