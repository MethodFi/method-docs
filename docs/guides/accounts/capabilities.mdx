# Capabilities
Capabilities determine the possible actions an account is allowed to take. Accounts are
granted capabilities based on the type of account and verification completed.

An account's capabilities can be revoked due to payment failures. See
[payment errors and capabilities](/guides/payments/lifecycle-and-errors#errors-and-capabilities).

Accounts with the `closed`, `processing`, or `disabled` status will not have any
capabilities. See [account statuses](/api/core/accounts/object#account-statuses) to learn more.

:::caution
Since an account is owned by an entity, capabilities of that entity take precedence over
an account's capabilities.

__Example__: Accounts, with the `payments:send` capability owned by an entity __without__ the `payments:send`
capability are not allowed to send payments.
