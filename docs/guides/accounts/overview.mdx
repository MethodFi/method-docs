# Overview
An account represents an entity's financial account. This includes
ACH accounts (checking or savings) and liability
accounts (student loans, credit cards, mortgages, and other types of debt accounts).

---

### Source accounts
All source accounts are ACH accounts (checking or savings). Payment funds
are pulled from these accounts and sent to a destination account. A source
account is determined by whether an ACH account has the `payments:send` capability.

#### ACH verification
For some teams, ACH accounts are required to be verified in order to
activate the `payments:send` capability and start sending payments.

➡️ See the [ach verification](/guides/accounts/ach-verification) section to learn more.

### Destination accounts
Destination accounts are accounts where payment funds are sent to.
In most cases, destination accounts are liability accounts, although ACH
accounts may also be considered destination accounts. A destination
account is determined by whether an account has the `payments:receive` capability.

#### Destination accounts created with Method Data
If an entity has successfully completed the [identify verification flow](/guides/entities/identity-verification),
all of their debt accounts have already been retrieved, and a corresponding
Method liability account for each has been created. Liability accounts created
through this flow ([Method Data](https://methodfi.com/products/data)) are
enhanced with [more comprehensive data](/guides/accounts/retrieve-liability-account-data) and
automatically ready to receive payments with the `payments:receive` capability.

### Capabilities
Capabilities determine the possible actions an account is allowed to take. Accounts are
granted capabilities based on the type of account and verification completed.

➡️ See the [capabilities](/guides/accounts/capabilities) section to learn more.
