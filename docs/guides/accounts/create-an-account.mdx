# Create an account

import AccountsCreateACH from '../../../src/snippets/AccountsCreateACH';
import MerchantSearchByName from '../../../src/snippets/MerchantSearchByName';
import AccountsCreateLiability from '../../../src/snippets/AccountsCreateLiability';


There are two types of accounts. ACH accounts (checking or savings), and
liability accounts (student loans, credit cards, mortgages, and other types of debt accounts).
Each account is owned by an entity, and an entity can own multiple accounts.

ℹ️ See [the account object](/api/core/accounts/object#account-object) for details on the API.

### ACH account

You only need basic ACH information to start creating an ACH account:

- A __routing number__ which is used to identify a bank account or financial institution.
- An __account number__ that uniquely identifies the account.
- The __type__ of ACH account (checking or savings).

This information can be collected from your users through the following methods:

- __Plaid Auth__ - Plaid provides this information within their [Plaid Auth product](https://plaid.com/docs/auth/).
- __MX__ - MX provides this information within their [Verification product](https://docs.mx.com/atrium#premium_features_verification)
- __User provided__ - you can alternatively collect this information from your users using
your own implementation.

:::note
The `holder_id` field in the request below refers to the `id` of an entity that owns this account.
If you have not created an entity, see [create an entity](/guides/entities/create-an-entity).
:::

:::tip
If the newly created ACH account does not contain the `payments:send` capability,
you must next verify this account in order to start sending funds from it. See
the [ach verification](/guides/accounts/ach-verification) for more details.

### Liability account
Liability accounts are accounts that hold a type of debt or balance owed to a financial institution, and can
only be used to receive payments. Each liability account belongs to a financial institution, which is also referred to as
a [merchant](/api/core/merchants/object) in the Method ecosystem.

The verification process for liability accounts happen immediately upon creation. This process
determines if the provided account number exists within a specific financial institution.

:::tip
You can automatically retrieve and create liability accounts for an entity using
__Method Data__. See the [retrieve an entity's debts](/guides/quick-start/retrieve-an-entitys-debts) guide
to learn more.
:::

Before creating a liability account, ensure that you have gathered the following liability account information:
- The `mch_id` of the merchant that corresponds to the account's financial institution.
- The `account_number` for the liability account.
- The `id` of the entity that owns the account.

#### Search for a merchant
Merchants are financial institutions that accept payments for liability accounts. A merchant's
`mch_id` is required to create a liability account. Below is an example on how to search
for a merchant.

ℹ️ See [list merchants](/api/core/merchants/list) for details on the API.

<MerchantSearchByName />

##### Response
```json
[
  {
    "mch_id": "mch_2",
    "parent_name": "FedLoan",
    "name": "FedLoan Servicing - Student Loans",
    "logo": "https://static.methodfi.com/mch-logos/1616215578688-fedloan.png",
    ...
  }
]
```

#### Create liability account
After searching for the corresponding merchant, you can now create the liability account.
