# Elements Javascript SDK

Method provides a script to seamlessly integrate [Elements](../../10.%20Elements/1-IntroToElements.md) into your web application.


### Installation

Include the initialization script into your application's main `html` file.


```html
<script src="https://static.methodfi.com/elements/v1/stable/init.js"></script>
```

### Configuration

Once the initialization script has been included into your application, create an instance of the `Method` class.

```js
const config = {
  env: 'production', // dev | sandbox | production
  onEvent: (event) => {
    // Invoked for every event triggerd by the element.
    // Event is a native MessageEvent instance.
  },
  onSuccess: (payload) => {
    // Invoked when an account has successfully been linked.
    // After accounts are linked, `payload.accounts` will contain a list
    // of public account tokens which you will be exchanged for an
    // account through the Method API.
  },
  onError: (error) => {
    // Invoked when an error is raised during.
  },
  onExit: (payload) => {
    // Invoked when a user exits any element flow, or
    // immediately after an error is raised.
  },
  onOpen : (payload) => {
    // Invoked when an element has successfully launched.
  },
};

const method = new Method(config);
```

| `onSuccess` | `Function` | A callback invoked with `payload` when an element's flow has successfully been completed. See the [success](/docs/api/elements/events#success) event. |
| `onError`   | `Function` | A callback invoked with `error` when an error is raised by the element. See the [error](/docs/api/elements/events#error) event.                   |
| `onExit`    | `Function` | A callback invoked with `payload` when an element exits. See the [exit](/docs/api/elements/events#exit) event.                                     |

### Launch

#### Retrieve an element token

Before you can launch an element, you must first create an `element_token` for the element through the Method API.

In this example, we're creating an `element_token` for the [Link Element](/docs/api/elements/intro).

<ElementsCreateLinkToken2 />

```json
{
  "element_token": "pk_elem_BtzySdrQGFmLdAPw5gXSQNCxQkhCkT3K"
}
```

➡️ See [create an element token](/docs/api/elements/link/implementation/create-token) for more info.

#### Launch the element

Now that a `Method` instance and an `element_token` have been created, you can now launch the element.

```js
method.open('pk_elem_BtzySdrQGFmLdAPw5gXSQNCxQkhCkT3K');
```
