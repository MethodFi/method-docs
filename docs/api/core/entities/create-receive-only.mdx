# Create a receive only entity

**About**: Creates a new receive only entity. Receive only entities can only be used as a `destination` in a `Payment`. This type of entity allows you to push money to an entities' accounts without needing extensive KYC / AML PII ("Personally identifiable information). Receive only entities should be used as a last resort or for one-of payments.

**API Method**: `POST /entities`

:::tip
To create a receive only entity, either the email or phone must be provided. Receive only entities cannot be updated.
:::

:::caution Deprecation
As of 2021-06-27, receive only entities are being deprecated. We recommend using an `individual` entity with `payments:receive` capabilities. See [Entity Capabilities](/docs/api/core/entities/object#entity-capabilities) for more info.
