# The entity object

Entities are a representation of your application's end-users. Throughout Method's ecosystem, an `Entity` is the legal owner of any `Account`. When creating an `Entity` we will perform a KYC / AML verification on your behalf. In most cases, the verification takes seconds and only requires basic information from your end-user.

Entities can be either an 1) individual/person, 2) company/corporation.

* `data:retrieve`
The entity can automatically retrieve and link their debts
through [Method Data - Retrieve an entity's debts](/guides/quick-start/retrieve-an-entitys-debts).
*Minimum required information:* `first_name`, `last_name`, and `phone`.

* `data:sync` *Minimum required information:* `first_name`, `last_name`, and `phone`.

### Entity Statuses

An entity will enter the following statuses as it undergoes KYC / AML verification.

* `active`
The entity has passed basic KYC / AML verification. Once active, the entity will
have at least the `payments:receive` capability.

* `incomplete`
The entity does not have any capabilities yet. Update the entity by providing
more information to enable capabilities.

* `disabled`

can transition into the `disabled` status if an entity revokes authorization
