# The entity object

Entities are a representation of your application's end-users. Throughout Method's ecosystem, an `Entity` is the legal owner of any `Account`. When creating an `Entity` we will perform a KYC / AML verification on your behalf. In most cases, the verification takes seconds and only requires basic information from your end-user.

Entities can be either an 1) individual/person, 2) company/corporation.
