# Create an individual entity

**About**: Creates a new individual entity, and initiates the KYC / AML verification. The identity verification will almost always be fulfilled synchronously. If a verification takes longer than 5 seconds, the request will be handled asynchronously and a webhook will be fired when there is an update.

An Entity can be created with an empty object and progressively updated with more information from your end user. See [Entity Capabilities](/api/core/entities/object#entity-capabilities) for more info.

**API Method**: `POST /entities`

:::tip
We recommend verifying the entity's phone number and email before initiating the verification process.
