      In order to lower the risk of failed/returned payments, ACH accounts must first be
      verified to ensure ownership and validity of the account before it can be used
      to send payments.
      Account verification only applies to ACH
      accounts. <strong>Liability accounts don't require this verification step</strong> since account
      numbers are validated automatically with the merchant.
      <hr className="dotted-divider" />
      <span className="pill-warning">⚠️ Caution:</span> In the <code>dev</code>, and <code>sandbox</code> environments,
      ACH accounts are automatically verified by default. If you would like to disable this feature to fully
      simulate the verification process for the <code>production</code> environment, please contact support
      at <a href="mailto:team@methodfi.com">team@methodfi.com</a>.
