# The verification object
In order to lower the risk of failed/returned payments, ACH accounts must first be verified to ensure ownership and validity of the account before it can be used to send payments.

Account verification only applies to ACH accounts. __Liability accounts don't require this verification step__  since account numbers are validated automatically with the merchant.

:::caution
In the `dev`, and `sandbox` environments, ACH accounts are automatically verified by default. If you would like to disable this feature to fully simluate the verification process for the `production` environment, please contact support at team@methodfi.com

#### Verification Statuses
The following are possible statuses a verification can be in.

- `initiated` The initial status of a verification.
- `pending` For verifications of type `micro_deposits`, this is when the micro-deposits have been sent to the associated bank account. You can only verify the deposited amounts once the verification is in this status.
- `verified` The verification was successful, and the associated ACH account will have an additional `payments:send` capability. See [account capabilities](/api/core/accounts/object#account-capabilities) for more info.
- `disabled` Multiple unsuccessful attempts have been made to complete the verification.


#### Verification Types
The following are possible types by which an ACH account can be verified.

- `micro_deposits` Two small amounts of money will be deposited into the ACH account, once received (within 1 - 3 business days) the account holder will then [verify the amounts (in cents) that were deposited](/api/core/accounts/ach-verification/update).
- `plaid` The Account is verified by providing balance and transaction data from Plaid.
- `teller` The Account is verified by providing balance and transaction data from Teller.
- `mx` The account is verified by providing account and transaction data from MX.
- `auto_verify` The account was verified with Plaid through the [Method Link Element](/api/elements/link/intro) or the account was verified automatically in the `dev` or `sandbox` environment where verification is disabled by default.
