# Update a verification

**About**: This endpoint is to confirm the two amounts (in cents) deposited into the associated ACH account. Only verifications of type `micro_deposits` are allowed to be updated.

**API Method**: `PUT /accounts/:accountId/verification`

:::caution Important
If multiple unsuccessful attempts have been made, the verification will transition into the `disabled` status. In this case, a new ACH account and verification must be created.
