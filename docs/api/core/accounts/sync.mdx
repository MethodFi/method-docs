      Sync an account allows you to fetch real-time data for a liability directly from the Merchant (FI). A sync can be
      initiated for an account containing the <code>data:sync</code> capability
      in <code>available_capability</code> or <code>capability</code>.
      <hr className="dotted-divider" />
      <h4>About Method Sync</h4>
      <p>
        âœ¨ Method Sync allows you to retrieve real-time enhanced data for any liability created in Method. Method Sync is available
        for a fast growing list of <code>merchants</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Sync, you can fetch key liability details such
        as <code>interest_rate_percentage</code>, <code>payoff_amount</code>, <code>balance</code> and much more
        in real-time directly from the servicer or financial institution.
        See all <a href="../../../guides/accounts/retrieve-liability-account-data">available data fields</a> per
        liability type.
      </p>
      <hr className="dotted-divider" />
      <h4>Tips</h4>
      <p>
        Method Sync interfaces directly with financial institutions, as a result, syncs in average
        take &lt; 60 seconds to complete, but in rare-cases can take up to 180 seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        ðŸ’¡ To check the status of a sync use the <code>data_status</code> and <code>data_last_successful_sync</code> in
        the <code>account.liability</code> response.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sync is optimized for speed, and will eagerly save / notify of new updates to a
        liability (even if the sync is still <code>in_progress</code> and incomplete)
        In practice, this means that some fields might temporarily return <code>null</code> while we wait for
        data to be received from the financial institution.
      </p>
      <p>
        ðŸ’¡ We recommend subscribing to <code>account:update</code> <a href="/api/core/webhooks/object">webhook</a> to
        be notified of all changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Liability accounts that are created in dev environments will not have syncing capabilities enabled by default.
      </p>
      <p>
        ðŸ’¡ To simulate Sync in dev environments, use one of the
        provided <code>mch_id</code> and <code>account_number</code> pairs.
        See <a href="/guides/accounts/create-an-account#simulate-sync">Simulate Sync</a> for more details.
      </p>

      <h4>Nightly Sync</h4>
      <p>
        After a successful initial sync, a liability account will receive nightly data updates directly from
        the financial institution. You'll be notified in real-time of any updates via
        an <code>account:update</code> webhook.
