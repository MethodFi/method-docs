# Sync an account

**About**: Sync an account allows you to fetch real-time data for a liability directly from the Merchant (FI). A sync can be
initiated for an account containing the `data:sync` capability in `available_capability` or `capability`.

**API Method**: `POST /accounts/:account_id/syncs`

### Primer on Sync

#### About Method Sync
‚ú® Method Sync allows you to retrieve real-time enhanced data for any liability created in Method. Method Sync is available
for a fast growing list of `merchants`.

With Sync, you can fetch key liability details such as `interest_rate_percentage`, `payoff_amount`, `balance` and much more
in real-time directly from the servicer or financial institution. ‚û°Ô∏è See all [available data fields](../../../guides/accounts/retrieve-liability-account-data) per liability type.

#### Tips

Method Sync interfaces directly with financial institutions, as a result, syncs in average take <60 seconds to complete,
but in rare-cases can take up to 180 seconds.

üí° To check the status of a sync use the `data_status` and `data_last_successful_sync` in the `account.liability` response.

Sync is optimized for speed, and will eagerly save / notify of new updates to a liability (even if the sync is still `in_progress` and incomplete)
In practice, this means that some fields might temporarily return `null` while we wait for data to be received from the financial institution.

üí° We recommend subscribing to `account:update` [webhook](/api/core/webhooks/object) to be notified of all changes.

Liability accounts that are created in dev environments will not have syncing capabilities enabled by default.

üí° To simulate Sync in dev environments, use one of the provided `mch_id` and `account_number` pairs. 
  See [Simulate Sync](http://localhost:3000/guides/accounts/create-an-account#simulate-sync-for-a-liability-account) for more details.

#### Nightly Sync
After a successful initial sync, a liability account will receive nightly data updates directly from the financial institution.
You'll be notified in real-time of any updates via an `account:update` webhook.
