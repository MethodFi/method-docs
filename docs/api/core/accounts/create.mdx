# Create an account

**About**: Creates a new account for a unique entity, either `ach` or `liability`, based on the parameters provided. An account is a unique representation of an `ach` or `liability` account.

**API Method**: `POST /accounts`

#### <u>Collecting a liability's account number</u>

Due to the sensitive nature of a liability's account number, we recommend collecting the account number from your end-user using a third-party aggregator (e.g. Plaid) or using Method Link.

1. __Using a third-party aggregator__ - Student loans linked to your app using [Plaid Liabilities](https://plaid.com/products/liabilities)
2. __Using Method Link__ - Recommended for liabilities that you do not have the account number for, and need to collect it from your end-user. (Example: PAN for credit card liabilities). ‚û°Ô∏è Method Link securely transmits it directly to Method without it passing through your servers.

Creating a `liability` account will automatically validate the account number with the
merchant in order to lower the risk of failed/returned payments

:::tip
We recommend using __[Method's data product](https://methodfi.com/products/data)__ to easily retrieve all of a person's debts
and automatically create `liability` accounts for each of those debts.

‚û°Ô∏è See our __[Retrieve an entity's debts](/guides/quick-start/retrieve-an-entitys-debts)__ quick start
guide to get started.

#### <u>ACH account verification</u>
Creating an `ach` account will require an additional step for verification to confirm
the validity of the account. ‚û°Ô∏è See [ACH account verification.](/api/core/accounts/ach-verification/object)

<!-- > ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Important**: The `holder_id` is the `Entity` id for the legal holder of the `Account`. Associating the incorrect `Entity` will lead to failed / returned payments. -->
