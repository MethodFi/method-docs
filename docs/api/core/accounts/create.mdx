# Create an account

**About**: Creates a new account for a unique entity, either `ach` or `liability`, based on the parameters provided. An account is a unique representation of an `ach` or `liability` account.

**API Method**: `POST /accounts`

#### Collecting a liability's account number

Due to the sensitive nature of a liability's account number, we recommend collecting the account number from your end-user using a third-party aggregator (e.g. Plaid) or using Method Link.

1. _Using a third-party aggregator_ - Student loans linked to your app using [Plaid Liabilities](https://plaid.com/products/liabilities)
2. _Using Method Link_ - Recommended for liabilities that you do not have the account number for, and need to collect it from your end-user. (Example: PAN for credit card liabilities). ➡️ Method Link securely transmits it directly to Method without it passing through your servers.

:::note
Creating a `liability` account will automatically validate the account number with the merchant in order to lower the risk of failed/returned payments.
:::

:::note
Creating an `ach` account will require an additional step for verification to confirm the validity of the account. ➡️ See [ACH account verification.](/docs/api/core/accounts/ach-verification/object)

<!-- > ℹ️ **Important**: The `holder_id` is the `Entity` id for the legal holder of the `Account`. Associating the incorrect `Entity` will lead to failed / returned payments. -->
