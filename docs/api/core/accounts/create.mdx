# Create an account

**About**: Creates a new account for a unique entity, either `ach` or `liability`, based on the parameters provided. An account is a unique representation of an `ach` or `liability` account.

**API Method**: `POST /accounts`

#### <u>Collecting a liability's account number</u>

Due to the sensitive nature of a liability's account number, we recommend collecting the account number from your end-user using one of the secure pathways below.

1. Method Data - üí° You can automatically retrieve all of an entity's liabilities using Method Data. See the [retrieve an entity's debts](/guides/quick-start/retrieve-an-entitys-debts) guide to learn more.
2. Method Link - üì± You can embed the Link Element to securly allow your user's to connect their debts directly to Method. See [Overview of Link Element](/api/elements/link/intro) to learn more.
3. API + Third Party Aggregator - You will need the `merchant` id (`mch_id`) and the account number of the liability. Use an aggregator such as Plaid.

Creating a `liability` account will automatically validate the account number with the
merchant in order to lower the risk of failed/returned payments

#### <u>ACH account verification</u>
Creating an `ach` account will require an additional step for verification to confirm
the validity of the account. ‚û°Ô∏è See [ACH account verification.](/api/core/accounts/ach-verification/object)

<!-- > ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Important**: The `holder_id` is the `Entity` id for the legal holder of the `Account`. Associating the incorrect `Entity` will lead to failed / returned payments. -->
