# The account object

Accounts are a representation of an entity's financial accounts. An account can be a checking or savings account (`ach`) or a credit card, student loan, etc. (`liability`)

* To create an `ach` account you will need the routing and account number of the depository account. We recommend using [Plaid](https://plaid.com/products/auth) to retrieve your entity's `ach` information.

* To create a `liability` account you can use:
    - Method Data - 💡 You can automatically retrieve all of an entity's liabilities using Method Data. See the [retrieve an entity's debts](/guides/quick-start/retrieve-an-entitys-debts) guide to learn more.
    - Method Link - 📱 You can embed the Link Element to securly allow your user's to connect their debts directly to Method. See [Overview of Link Element](/api/elements/link/intro) to learn more.
    - API - You will need the `merchant` id (`mch_id`) and the account number of the liability.

:::info Important
The `holder_id` is the id of the `Entity` who owns this account. Associating the incorrect `Entity` will lead to failed/returned payments.

#### Account Capabilities

The following are possible capabilities an account can have. This indicates if an account is capable of receiving money (as a destination) or sending money (as a source).


ℹ️ ACH accounts, require an [additional verification step](/api/core/accounts/ach-verification/object) to start sending money.

- `payments:receive` The account can be used as a payment destination.
- `payments:send` The account can be used as a payment source.
- `data:retrieve` The account has additional liability information from [Method Data](/guides/quick-start/retrieve-an-entitys-debts).
- `data:sync` The account has enhanced data and live data refresh from FI via Method Sync.

#### Account Statuses

The following are possible statuses and account can be in.

* `active`
The account has at least the `payments:receive` capability.

* `disabled`
The account has been disabled and no longer has capabilities. Accounts
can transition into the `disabled` status if a related payment
fails due to invalid account information.

* `closed`
The account was created using [Method Data](/guides/quick-start/retrieve-an-entitys-debts) and is
either fully paid-off or no longer exists. Accounts in `closed` will not have capabilities.

* `processing`
The account was created using [Method Data](/guides/quick-start/retrieve-an-entitys-debts) and is
currently being processed. Once that account has successfully been processed, its status
will transition to active and will be available to receive payments. Accounts in `processing` will
not have capabilities.

#### Liability Account Types

The following are possible values for `liability.type`. For any of these values except `unknown`,
a corresponding key with the same name will be populated with data for that specific type.

__Example__: If an account has `liability.type` equal to `credit_card`, then `liability.credit_card` will
be populated with credit card information.

- `student_loan`, `credit_card`, `loan`, `auto_loan`, `mortgage`, `unknown`.
