      Accounts are a representation of an entity's financial accounts. An
      account can be a checking or savings account (<code>ach</code>) or
      a credit card, student loan, etc. (<code>liability</code>).
      <br/><br/>
      <h4>ACH</h4>
      To create an <code>ach</code> account you will need the routing and account number
      of the depository account. We recommend using <a href="https://plaid.com/products/auth">Plaid</a> to retrieve
      your entity's <code>ach</code> information.
      <br/><br/>
      <h4>Liability</h4>
      To create a <code>liability</code> account you can use:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>üí° Method Data</strong> - you can
          automatically retrieve all of an entity's liabilities using
          Method Data. See the <a href="/guides/quick-start/retrieve-an-entitys-debts">retrieve an entity's debts</a> guide
          to learn more.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>üì± Method Link</strong> - you can embed the Link Element to securely allow your user's to connect
          their debts directly to Method. See the <a href="/api/elements/link/intro">Overview of Link Element</a> to
          learn more.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>‚ö° API</strong> - You will need the <code>merchant</code> id (<code>mch_id</code>) and
          the account number of the liability.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span className="pill-info">‚ÑπÔ∏è Important:</span> the <code>holder_id</code> is the id of
      the <code>Entity</code> who owns this account. Associating the incorrect <code>Entity</code> will lead to
      failed/returned payments.

#### Account Capabilities

The following are possible capabilities an account can have. This indicates if an account is capable of receiving money (as a destination) or sending money (as a source).


‚ÑπÔ∏è ACH accounts, require an [additional verification step](/api/core/accounts/ach-verification/object) to start sending money.

- `payments:receive` The account can be used as a payment destination.
- `payments:send` The account can be used as a payment source.
- `data:retrieve` The account has additional liability information from [Method Data](/guides/quick-start/retrieve-an-entitys-debts).
- `data:sync` The account has enhanced data and live data refresh from FI via Method Sync.

#### Account Statuses

The following are possible statuses and account can be in.

* `active`
The account has at least the `payments:receive` capability.

* `disabled`
The account has been disabled and no longer has capabilities. Accounts
can transition into the `disabled` status if a related payment
fails due to invalid account information.

* `closed`
The account was created using [Method Data](/guides/quick-start/retrieve-an-entitys-debts) and is
either fully paid-off or no longer exists. Accounts in `closed` will not have capabilities.

* `processing`
The account was created using [Method Data](/guides/quick-start/retrieve-an-entitys-debts) and is
currently being processed. Once that account has successfully been processed, its status
will transition to active and will be available to receive payments. Accounts in `processing` will
not have capabilities.

#### Liability Account Types

The following are possible values for `liability.type`. For any of these values except `unknown`,
a corresponding key with the same name will be populated with data for that specific type.

__Example__: If an account has `liability.type` equal to `credit_card`, then `liability.credit_card` will
be populated with credit card information.

- `student_loan`, `credit_card`, `loan`, `auto_loan`, `mortgage`, `unknown`.
