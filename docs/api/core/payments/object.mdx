# The payment object

Payments allow you to easily move money between two accounts. Using payments you can move money between two `ach` accounts (e.g. Checking & Savings) or move money (_pay_) a `liability` (e.g. Student Loans, Credit Cards, etc.)

All payments are processed electronically between the source and destination, and take 2-3 business days depending on the receiving institution.

#### Cutoff Time
Payments are processed on business days (Monday - Friday) at 10:30 AM and 1:30 PM CST excluding US Banking Holidays.

### Payment Statuses

A payment will enter the following statuses as it is processed.

* `pending`
Initial status after the payment is created. Payment will stay in this state until it is
processed (see: [Cutoff Time](#cutoff-time)). Payment can be deleted in this state.

* `processing`
The payment is being processed. At this point, the payment can no longer be deleted.

* `sent`
The payment has been executed and sent to the banking networks.

* `failed`
An error occurred while either pulling funds from the source account or
pushing funds to the destination account.

* `canceled`
The payment was canceled and was never processed.

* `reversal_required`
The payment failed and requires a reversal. The payment's `reversal_id` is set with the `id` of the
newly created reversal. The reversal should then be approved.

* `reversal_processing`
The active reversal corresponding to this payment has been approved and is being processed.

* `reversed`
The active reversal has successfully been completed.

### Payment Fund Statuses

A payment's funds will enter the following statuses as it is processed.

* `pending`
Initial fund status after the payment is created.

* `requested`
The payment funds have been requested from the source account.

* `clearing`
The payment funds from the source account have been received.

* `failed`
The clearing of funds for a payment have failed.

* `sent`
The payment funds have been sent to the destination account.

* `unknown`
The status of the payment's funds is unknown.


### Payment Fee Types

A payment's fee type determines how much of the payment's amount will
be deducted from the amount received by the destination account.

* `total`
This fee type will deduct a flat fee from the amount
received by the destination account.

  __Example:__ If a $10.00 payment is created with a `total` fee of $2.00, then the resulting
  amount received by the destination account will be $8.00.

  This means that you make total of $2.00 from the payment. However, the
  Method fee for this payment will still be included in your monthly
  invoice.

  ```
  Received by destination = Payment - Total fee
  $8.00                   = $10.00  - $2.00
  ```

* `markup`
This fee type will deduct a fee on top of Method's per-payment fee
from the amount received by the destination account

  __Example:__ If a $10.00 payment is created with a `markup` fee of $2.00
  and your Method fee is $1.00, then the resulting amount received by the
  destination account will be $7.00 (Amount - Markup Fee - Method Fee).

  This means that you make $2.00 from the payment. Additionally, the Method fee
  has already been covered by the source account, and this completed payment
  will not be included in your monthly invoice.

  ```
  Received by destination = Payment - Markup fee - Example Method per-payment fee
  $7.00                   = $10.00  - $2.00      - $1.00
  ```
