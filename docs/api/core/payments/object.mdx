# The payment object

Payments allow you to easily move money between two accounts. Using payments you can move money between two `ach` accounts (e.g. Checking & Savings) or move money (_pay_) a `liability` (e.g. Student Loans, Credit Cards, etc.)

All payments are processed electronically between the source and destination, and take 2-3 business days depending on the receiving institution.

#### Cutoff Time
Payments are processed on business days (Monday - Friday) at 2:30 PM CST excluding US Banking Holidays.
