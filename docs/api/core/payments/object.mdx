      Payments allow you to easily move money between two accounts. Using payments
      you can move money between two <code>ach</code> accounts (e.g. Checking & Savings) or
      move money (<strong>pay</strong>) a <code>liability</code> (e.g. Student Loans, Credit Cards, etc.)
      All payments are processed electronically between the source and destination, and
      take 2-3 business days depending on the receiving institution.
      <hr className="dotted-divider"/>
      <h4>Cutoff Time</h4>
      Payments are processed on business days (Monday - Friday), excluding US Banking Holidays.

              invoice.

              amount received by the destination account
              <hr className="dotted-divider" />

              <br/>
              This means that you make $2.00 from the payment. Additionally, the Method fee
              has already been covered by the source account, and this completed payment
              will not be included in your monthly invoice.
