# The webhook object

Webhooks allow the Method API to notify your application when certain events occur.

To receive webhook notifications, you must first register the URL where the webhook should be sent and the triggering event. When the event occurs, the API will send an HTTP request containing the notification to the specified URL. If a valid HTTP response is not received, the API will retry.
