# HTTP Errors
Method uses HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of API requests.

### 5XX - Internal error
HTTP errors that return a code of `5XX` indicate that an error with Method's servers has
occurred. Once an error of this type is returned, the Method team is immediately notified
and begins triaging its root cause to push out a fix.

### 4XX - Invalid request
Most errors that occur while interacting with the Method API are of this type.
