# Overview

This is an overview of all possible errors in the Method API.

Errors may occur either when a request is made ([HTTP errors](/api/errors/http)), or when a process fails after a specific resource
(`entity`, `account`, `payment`, etc.) is has been created â€“ ([Resource errors](/api/errors/resource)).

### Error object
All errors are represented as a JSON object with the following properties:

Name | Type | Description
---------|----------|---------
`code` | `integer` | A numerical code of the error.
`type` | `string` | A broad description of the error.
`sub_type` | `string` | The specific error type.
`message` | `string` | A human-readable message providing more details about the error.

### HTTP error codes
For HTTP errors, `code` refers to an [HTTP response status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes).

* `2XX`: indicates success
* `4XX`: indicates an invalid request, or developer-related issues. (e.g. a required parameter is missing from the request body.)
* `5XX`: indicates Method-related issues

#### Example HTTP error
```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "INVALID_REQUEST",
    "code": 400,
    "sub_type": "INVALID_AMOUNT",
    "message": "Invalid amount received. The minimum amount for a payment is 100 cents ($1.00)."
  }
}
```

### Resource error codes
* `10XXX`: indicates that an error is related to a payment resource.
* `11XXX`: indicates that an error is related to an account resource.
* `12XXX`: indicates that an error is related to an entity resource.
* `13XXX`: indicates that an error is related to an account verification resource.
* `14XXX`: indicates that an error is related to a payment reversal resource.
