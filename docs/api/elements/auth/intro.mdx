# Overview of the Auth Element
The Auth Element allows your users to automatically connect all their debt accounts
into Method by verifying their identity.

### Auth Element
The demo below exhibits the multiple use cases in which the Auth Element may be used in your application.

#### Simulate Requirements
To simulate the amount of information required from the user in the `dev` environments,
provide a phone number from the table below to dictate the minimum requirements.

For the `dev` environments, you may provide any value for name, dob, and address.

:::caution
Providing a phone number in the `dev` environments that is not listed
in the table below will not verify a user's identity.
:::

| Phone          | Minimum Requirements                      |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `+15121231111` | Name, Phone                               |
| `+15121231112` | Name, Phone, DOB (Date of birth)          |
| `+15121231113` | Name, Phone, DOB (Date of birth), Address |

#### Security questions
After the user's identity has been verified, the user will then be presented with a list of security questions
which they must correctly answer. In the `dev` and `sandbox` environments, you may choose `Correct` to
select the correct option or `Incorrect` to select the incorrect option.

### Auth Element Flow Overview
The Auth Element flow begins once your user is required to connect their debt accounts to Method.

#### 1. Create Element Token
Your backend server will make a request to `/elements/token` to generate a `element_token` for
an `entity`. This `element_token` will be used to initialize the Auth Element in your app.

➡️ [Implementation Guide - Create Element Token](/api/elements/auth/implementation/create-token)

#### 2. Launch Auth Element
Using the `element_token` to launch the Auth Element for your user. Once the user successfully
verifies their identity, the Auth Element will return a `cxn_id` the ID of
the [created connection object](/api/core/connections/object).

#### 3. Retrieve Liability Data
After completing the Auth Element flow and receiving the `cxn_id`, you can now
inspect the connection and liability accounts that were automatically created.
