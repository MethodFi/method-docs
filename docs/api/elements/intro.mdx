# Overview of Method Elements
Method Elements is a collection of embeddable UI components that enhance and simplify your app's payment features. This allows you to securely collect information from your users. Tokenization, account creation and connection, and payment checkouts are all handled on your behalf.

### Elements Environments
Method Elements share the same env environments as the Method API. Method Elements should be launched in the same environment in which the `element_token` was generated.

➡️  See [Method Environments](/api/environments) for more info.

### Element Flow Overview
Each element flow begins with generating an `element_token` with specific initialization options through the Method API. This token will then be used to initialize the element within your app to complete a specific flow.

#### 1. Create Element Token
Depending on your user's journey within your app, your app's backend will request for an `element_token` corresponding to an `entity` from the `/elements/token` endpoint.

**Note**: Each `element_token` is only valid for 30 minutes after it has been created, and can only be used once.

#### 2. Initialize Element
Using the `element_token`, Method Elements will be initialized with the intended Element for your user.


#### 3. Handling Element Events
While your user interacts with an Element, events will be triggered for your app to handle. Each element flow will be different, therefore the completion depends on which Element is being used.
