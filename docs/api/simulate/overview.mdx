# Overview

To provide a seamless integration experience with Method in the
[development environment](/api/environments#development), you can simulate updates on resources as they
would naturally occur in the [sandbox](/api/environments#sandbox) and [production](/api/environments#production) environments.

Simulation endpoints are prefixed with `/simulate` and will be in the following format:

```
https://dev.methodfi.com/simulate/<RESOURCE_NAME>
```

where `RESOURCE_NAME` refers any resource that supports simulations.

---

:::caution Important
Simulation endpoints are only accessible in the development environment. Attempts to
access these endpoints in `sandbox` or `production` will result in a 403 Forbidden error.
:::

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "INVALID_REQUEST",
    "code": 403,
    "sub_type": "FORBIDDEN",
    "message": "Your authorization token is valid. However, you're unauthorized to access the requested resource."
  }
}
```
