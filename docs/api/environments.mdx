        Method has three primary API environments. Development, Sandbox and Production share similar functionality
        with minor differences. All testing should be done in the Development and Sandbox environments.
        All activity in the Production will be billed. Your team will have separate API keys for each Method
        environment. Keys are available under the Keys section in
        the <a href="https://dashboard.methodfi.com">Method Dashboard</a>.

        Development, Sandbox and Production share similar functionality with minor differences
        listed below. All merchant data is the same across all environments.

      <h4>Development</h4>
      ‚û°Ô∏è We recommend building your integration in the <code>Development</code> environment.
      This will prevent accidentally sending a payment while initially building / testing your integration.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Entities: KYC is disabled. All entities will become <code>active</code> immediately, once all the required information is provided.
        </li>
        <li>
          Entities Capabilities: <code>payments:receive</code> and <code>payments:sent</code> are granted for any
          valid entity input. <code>data:retrieve</code> and <code>data:sync</code> are only granted
          for <a href="elements/auth/intro#simulate-requirements">Simulated Entities</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Accounts: <code>account_numbers</code> are not validated and any input will be accepted.
        </li>
        <li>
          Link: Account numbers are not validated and any input will be accepted.
        </li>
        <li>
          Payments: Simulated - Payments will not be sent to our banking networks. However, the payment will
          transition to <code>sent</code> at the standard cutoff time for simulation purposes.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr className="dotted-divider" />
      <h4>Sandbox</h4>
      ‚û°Ô∏è We recommend switching to <code>Sandbox</code> once you are ready to test your integration with your own financial accounts.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Entities: KYC is enabled. All entities will undergo validation before being granted any capabilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Payments: Live - Payments will be sent to our banking networks at the standard cutoff times.
        </li>
        <li>
          Live Payment Limit: 20 transactions per month ($1 limit / transaction)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Production</h4>
